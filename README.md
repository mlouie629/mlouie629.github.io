# Final | Web Design I | Art Department | Queens College | Fall 2018
For your final project, you are to implement a web site rendition of the designs you created for the midterm. This web site should be a full implementation of your midterm designs, complete with working links, valid content, and responsive versions of all pages.

## Instructions
* All CSS in the `css` folder.
* All JavaScript, if applicable, in the `js` folder.
* All `.jpg` and `.png` image files in the `img` folder.
* No image file should be larger than 1MB.
* Only submit files that are required by your project: Do not submit working files, such as `.psd`, `.ai`, `.indd`, or `.sketch` files.
* Use lowercase, combined with kebab case, to name folders and files (`do-this` or `do-this.html`); no spaces in folder or file names (`not this`); no camel case (`notThis`); no snake case (`not_this`).
* Valid HTML, per the [w3c-validation](https://atom.io/packages/w3c-validation) Atom package discussed in class. **Note**: The original HTML validator from the syllabus is invalid, also per our discussion in a previous class. You may also validate at [http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
* Valid CSS, per the same [w3c-validation](https://atom.io/packages/w3c-validation) Atom package. You may also validate at [https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input).
